## Personal vim configuration

This is the vim configuration file I am using on my personal computer.

Though I am ignorant of vim script, I have put together this configuration after following various blogs and copied a lot of configuration  settings from various sources.

## Features

  - I am using Plug [Minimalist Vim Plugin Manager](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug).
  - I am using Language Server Protocol supported by the LSP client plugin from [LanguageClient-Neovim](https://github.com/autozimu/LanguageClient-neovim).
  - Additionally there are themes and minimal vim configurations.
